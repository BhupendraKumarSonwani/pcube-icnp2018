# Pcube

This was my RnD project under the guidance of Prof. Mythili Vutukuru and Prof. Purushottam Kulkarni at IIT Bombay during my undergrad. It was done in collaboration with Aniket Shirke and Rinku Shah.

This work was published at the IEEE ICNP 2018 workshop P4EU. The paper is available at my blog [here](https://www.akashtrehan.com/assets/pcube/pcube-icnp18.pdf) and the presentation slides are [here](https://www.akashtrehan.com/assets/pcube/pcube-slides-icnp18.pdf).

The official repository for this project is now [this one](https://github.com/networkedsystemsIITB/pcube). Please refer to that repo for the latest code and updates.
