Hi Vikas,

We are currently developing a new INT solution with the P4 Brigade. You can take a look at the proposal here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyFcEkBocTROYInFxclaQbKASvyXRBpLoSX07XPlUVM/edit?usp=sharing

If you are interested in collaborating and getting recognised for your work we can discuss some tasks you can do.

You are more then welcome to make any comments to this.
If you want you can also join the p4 brigade meetings where discuss this among other p4 topics: https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/P4+brigade

Cheers,
